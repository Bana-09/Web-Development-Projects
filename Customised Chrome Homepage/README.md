>This project is NOT Responsive to different screen sizes at all. I had made this earlier and it is made strictly according to Laptop-L (1440px) screen size. I dont know this will be selected or not considering this as a major drawback, but this was my first time making animations purely through Javascript.


# Customised Chrome Homepage

The plain Chrome homepage customised in accordance to my personal ideas, a little bit playfully. The concept of animation through Javascript is utilised in the project.
